# Development of a Brain MRI Classification System Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Designed and implemented a comprehensive pipeline for classifying brain MRI images as either healthy or tumor-affected. The project involved creating a custom PyTorch dataset class to preprocess and load MRI images, utilizing OpenCV for image manipulation and resizing. Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for binary classification, leveraging layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected networks. This project showcases proficiency in deep learning, image processing, and PyTorch for medical image analysis.




## Dataset

 - I have utilized the [Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection) dataset from Kaggle.
